dumb userscript for tweetdeck

###[install](https://github.com/no-boot-device/cuckoo/raw/master/main.user.js)

currently it only has an option to disable tweetdeck analytics    
but if you tweet a good idea at @no\_boot\_device, it might get implemented

## things that have already been requested 
* video uploading (i wish i could)
* polls (i'll try at some point)
* greentext (i'll think about it??)
