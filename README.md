dumb userscript for tweetdeck

###[install](https://github.com/no-boot-device/cuckoo/raw/master/main.user.js)
##faq:
###will you implement (x):
if you tweet a good idea at @no\_boot\_device, it might get implemented
#### things that have already been requested so don't request these:
* video uploading (i wish i could)
* polls (i'll try at some point)
* greentext (i'll think about it??)

###my tweetdeck's loading slowly!!!
welcome to using userscripts, loading takes longer.

###i'm stuck in a loop with "corrupted settings"
open up your dev console and make a pastebin of it, then send it to @NO\_BOOT\_DEVICE on twitter
